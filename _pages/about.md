Hi! I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE) at University College London (UCL) under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Boehm](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-jan-boehm), and I am an active member of the [Photogrammetry and 3D Imaging](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/research/groups-centres-and-sections/photogrammetry-and-3d-imaging) research group.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Computer Vision Research Intern at [DeepCamera Group](https://deepcamera.cyens.org.cy/), [CYENS](https://cyens.org.cy/mrg/ripe/), in Cyprus, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with supervisors [Dr. Alessandro Artusi](https://cyens.org.cy/personnel/alessandro-artusi/) and [Dr. Xenios Milidonis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xeniosmilidonis/?originalSubdomain=cy).

My research passion lies in the intersection of Cross-Sensor Label-Efficient Learning and 3D point cloud data, and their applications across various domains. As a dedicated student, I consistently invest my time and energy in pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology within the realm of 3D point cloud data. I am excited about the potential of my work to contribute to innovative solutions and advancements in the field.
